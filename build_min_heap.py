# Implement a Minheap class that supports
# Building a Min heap from an input array of integers
# Inserting integers in the heap
# Removing the heap's min/root value
# Peek at the heap's minimum/root value
# Sifting integers up and down the heap, which is to be used when
# inserting and revmong values 
# Note that heap should be represented in the form of an array

# class MinHeap:
#     def __init__(self, array):
#         self.heap = self.build_heap(array)

#     def peek(self):
#         return self.heap[0]

#     def swap(self, i, j, heap):
#         heap[i], heap[j] = heap[j], heap[i]
