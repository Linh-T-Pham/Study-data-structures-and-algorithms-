# Implement a Minheap class that supports
# Building a Min heap from an input array of integers
# Inserting integers in the heap
# Removing the heap's min/root value
# Peek at the heap's minimum/root value
# Sifting integers up and down the heap, which is to be used when
# inserting and revmong values 
# Note that heap should be represented in the form of an array
